      <h1>How Did It All Start?</h1>
      <p>
        This article is an editorial analysis based on public posts and user reports. It is not an official statement from Telegram, xAI, Elon Musk, or Pavel Durov.
      </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>March 26, 2025: Grok Was Announced for Telegram</h2>
        <p>
          On March 26, 2025, Elon Musk announced that Grok was coming to Telegram.
          By that time, Telegram had already reached around 1 billion users.
          Expanding to that audience looked like a major strategic move for both Grok and Telegram.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plans appeared ambitious: Grok was expected to work in private chats, groups, and channels;
          assist with moderation; summarize long posts and PDF files; and support many practical use cases.
        </p>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Two Months Later: Conflicting Public Statements</h2>
        <p>
          Roughly two months later, Pavel Durov said that a one-year deal with xAI had been signed,
          with terms described publicly as a large cash component plus a share of subscription revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, on the same day, Elon Musk disputed that framing publicly.
          This created an awkward public contradiction and immediate confusion around the real status of the deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, the bot launched and was reportedly available to Telegram Premium users.

        <h2>When the Problems Began</h2>
        <p>
          By early September 2025, users began reporting frequent issues.
          Soon after, many said the bot had stopped responding entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>@GrokAI</code> account remained visible in Telegram, but users reported no replies.

        <h2>What Caused the Deal to Collapse?</h2>
        <p>
          There is still no definitive public explanation.
          Neither Musk nor Durov provided a full public post-mortem of what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users reported submitting complaints to both Telegram and xAI, but there was no detailed official clarification.
          Many people said they felt misled because they bought Telegram Premium mainly for Grok access.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Main Hypotheses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Commercial disagreement over final price and revenue split.</li>
          <li>Strategic conflict between integrating Grok in Telegram versus prioritizing xAI/X ecosystem products.</li>
          <li>Reputational friction after same-day public contradiction.</li>
          <li>Changing product priorities as messaging + AI became a core competitive battleground.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Why the Privacy-Only Explanation Looks Incomplete</h2>
        <p>
          One popular theory is that the deal collapsed purely because of Telegram's strict standards around privacy and anonymity.
          That may be part of the story, but on its own it does not fully explain the timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grok had already been operating in Telegram for months.
          If privacy architecture were the sole blocker, the conflict likely would have surfaced earlier and in a more explicit way.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Strategic Context</h2>
        <p>
          Musk has had broad plans around XChat and deeper in-house AI integration.
          From that perspective, focusing on a proprietary ecosystem can be more attractive than strengthening a direct competitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the same period, Durov also discussed new AI-related directions inside the TON ecosystem,
          which suggests each side may have moved toward more independent long-term strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>What If You Still Want Grok in Telegram?</h2>
        <p>
          When it became clear that the official experience was not reliable, I looked for alternatives and did not find a consistently working bot.
          So I built my own bot for personal use first, and then developed it into a full project.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The Grok-in-Telegram story was loud, but the ending was quiet.
          Whether it was money, strategy, or personal conflict, the full reason may never be publicly disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          What do you think was the real reason behind the split?
